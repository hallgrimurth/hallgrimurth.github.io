The story investigates patterns in **drug-related crime in San Francisco**, with a particular focus on the **Tenderloin district** over time. Emphasis is placed on creating a **visual narrative** grounded in public data.

## Mapping Drug Crime Patterns Across San Francisco

In this post, we explore the spatial distribution of drug-related crimes across San Francisco using a series of **choropleth maps**. The data focuses on the years **2016 to 2024**.

Below is a multi-panel figure showing yearly distributions:

### **Key Observations**
- **Tenderloin** remains the most consistently affected district throughout the time range.
- Adjacent districts like **Southern** and **Mission** show modest but visible activity.
- During **2020–2021**, a slight drop is visible, which may reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on policing or reporting.
- In **recent years (2022–2024)**, case numbers appear to rise again, with the Tenderloin still dominating the map in intensity.

### **Why It Matters**
These maps make it visually evident that **drug crime is not evenly distributed** across San Francisco. The persistent concentration in Tenderloin raises important questions and highlights the need for interventions.
