## About This Project

This site presents a data story created as part of the course **02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization** at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

The story investigates patterns in **drug-related crime in San Francisco**, with a particular focus on the **Tenderloin district** over time. Emphasis is placed on creating a **visual narrative** grounded in public data.

All figures, analyses, and visualizations were created using publicly available crime data from [SF OpenData](https://datasf.org/opendata/), with records dating back to **January 2003**.
